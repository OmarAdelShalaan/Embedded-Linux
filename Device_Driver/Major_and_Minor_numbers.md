# Major and Minor

Major and Minor numbers are concepts used in Unix-like operating systems,
 including Linux, to identify devices. Here's a brief explanation of major and minor numbers in the context of device drivers:

- **Major Number:** The major number identifies the type of device or driver in Linux. Each type of device (block devices, character devices) and each driver has a **unique** major number assigned to it. When a device file is created, the major number determines which driver handles operations on that file.
- **Minor Number:** The minor number is used to differentiate between individual devices of the same type that are managed by the same driver. For example, if you have multiple disks connected to your system, each disk might have a separate minor number assigned to it, allowing the driver to distinguish between them.


In terms of device driver programming, major and minor numbers are often used when registering device nodes in the system and handling I/O operations specific to a device.
