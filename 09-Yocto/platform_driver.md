Purpose of Platform Drivers:
Platform drivers handle devices that are not connected through standard buses like USB or PCI but are instead part of the hardware platform itself.
They manage devices such as sensors, GPIO controllers, system-specific peripherals, and other hardware components integrated into the system board.
Characteristics of Platform Drivers:
Direct Interface: Platform drivers interact directly with the hardware components they control, utilizing platform-specific APIs and interfaces provided by the hardware platform.
Integrated Devices: These drivers are often used for devices that are part of the system-on-chip (SoC) or are tightly integrated with the system architecture.
Components of Platform Drivers:
Initialization and Cleanup Functions: Similar to other device drivers, platform drivers have initialization (probe) and cleanup (remove) functions.
Device Data Structures: Define device-specific data structures and configurations, often including platform-specific data needed for initialization.
Platform Device Registration: Involves registering the platform driver with the platform bus, making the driver accessible to the system.
Kernel APIs and Macros for Platform Drivers:
platform_driver Structure: Defines a platform driver and contains function pointers for probe, remove, and other operations.
platform_device Structure: Represents a platform device and includes information such as device name, resource data, and driver association.
module_platform_driver() Macro: Simplifies platform driver registration and module loading.
Development Process for Platform Drivers:
Identify the platform-specific devices that need drivers and understand their hardware interfaces.
Write the platform driver code, including probe, remove, and other callback functions as needed.
Define platform-specific data structures and configurations required for device initialization.
Register the platform driver with the platform bus using appropriate APIs and structures.
Compile the driver into a loadable kernel module or build it directly into the kernel based on your requirements.
